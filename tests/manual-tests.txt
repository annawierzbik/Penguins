----> HERE IS OUR DOCUMENTATION OF A MANUAL TESTS WE CONDUCTED FOR VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR CODE INCLUDING:
    - Displaying the name of the player;
    - interpreting comand line parameters and reacting accordingly to incorrect input;
    - placement of the penguins and functions necesary for it to work correctly (count_my_penguins() and count_my_fish());
    - movement of the penguins;
    - writing the output file (as a part of either placement or movement test).

There also is a separate folder named "Full gameplay test" that shows the each one of the files created during the gameplay for two players.
